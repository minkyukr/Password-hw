# Password-hw
Tool to generate a password according to user's choice.
User can choose up to four characters:
  1. Upper Case
  2. Lower Case
  3. Symbols
  4. Numbers
 And also, the desired length of the password between 8 to 128.

Instructions:
1. User will click "generate password" button. This will prompt the choices stated above.
2. Following the prompt section, the password will be generated accordingly to user's choice.
3. There is also a button that copies to user's clipboard to his/her convenience.

One fault on this website is that once a password is generated, it will remain in the textbox.
Therefore if you click twice the "generate password" button, then it will concatenate the first and second password all together and so on.
Not sure how to fix this part.
